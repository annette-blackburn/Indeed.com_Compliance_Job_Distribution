    "#### Background: The computational project is designed with the goal of understanding the spatial distribution of compliance jobs in the United States. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021, there were a total of 334,340 compliance officers employed in the United States. Most of them are in charge of organizations’ internal compliance programs, under job titles such as “Occupational Health and Safety Specialist”, “Air Pollution Compliance Inspector”, and “Equal Employment Opportunity Investigator”. Despite the growing size of this job category, there is little understanding of its overall topology. How are these jobs distributed spatially as well as across industry? What range of mandates do compliance offices address? Which regulatory mandates generate the largest amount of compliance activity and which the least? "
